# 🚀 My C Programming Journey

Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository is a collection of everything I’ve learned and built while mastering the C language — from basic syntax and control structures to advanced concepts like file handling, data structures, and algorithms.

## 📌 Why C?

C is the foundation of modern programming. It's powerful, close to hardware, and widely used in system software, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. I chose C to strengthen my programming fundamentals and deepen my understanding of how software interacts with hardware.

## 📚 What’s Inside

### 🧠 Basics
- Variables, Data Types
- Operators & Expressions
- Input/Output (printf, scanf)
- Conditional Statements (if, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 🧩 Functions
- User-defined functions
- Function arguments (call by value/reference)
- Recursion

### 🗃️ Arrays & Strings
- 1D & 2D Arrays
- String manipulation without built-in libraries

### 📦 Pointers
- Pointer basics & arithmetic
- Pointers with arrays and functions
- Double pointers

### 🏗️ Structures & Unions
- Defining and using structs
- Nested structures
- Memory optimization using unions

### 🗂️ File Handling
- Reading/writing files
- File modes (r, w, a, etc.)
- Working with `fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`, `fgets`, etc.

### 📊 Data Structures (Intro)
- Linked Lists (singly)
- Stack & Queue (using arrays)
- Basic sorting/searching algorithms
